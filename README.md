# Automated Tax Filing Chatbot Backend

Welcome to the backend repository for the **Automated Tax Filing Chatbot**! This backend is built using **Python FastAPI**, a modern, fast web framework that is ideal for APIs. The backend handles OCR processing for W-2 forms, integrates with the IRS API for tax filing, and powers the chatbot's functionality.

---

## Features of the Backend

- **OCR Integration**: Processes uploaded W-2 forms to extract data using Optical Character Recognition (OCR).
- **IRS API Integration**: Connects with the IRS API to streamline tax filing and retrieval of tax-related information.
- **Chatbot Logic**: Implements the core chatbot functionality for user interaction and tax-related assistance.
- **Secure Data Handling**: Ensures sensitive user data is encrypted and complies with data security standards.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Built with FastAPI to support high-performance and scalability.
- **RESTful APIs**: Provides endpoints to serve the frontend and manage chatbot interactions.

---

## Tech Stack

- **FastAPI**: The web framework for building APIs.
- **Python 3.9+**: The programming language for the backend.
- **Tesseract OCR**: For extracting text from W-2 forms.
- **IRS API**: For tax-related data and filing integration.
- **SQLAlchemy**: For database interactions (or any other ORM of your choice).
- **Uvicorn**: For running the FastAPI app.
- **Pydantic**: For data validation and serialization.
- **JWT**: For user authentication and authorization (optional).

## Getting Started

## Requirements

* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/).
* [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for Python package and environment management.

## Docker Compose

Start the local development environment with Docker Compose following the guide in [../development.md](../development.md).

## General Workflow

By default, the dependencies are managed with [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), go there and install it.

From `./backend/` you can install all the dependencies with:

```console
$ uv sync
```

Then you can activate the virtual environment with:

```console
$ source .venv/bin/activate
```

Make sure your editor is using the correct Python virtual environment, with the interpreter at `backend/.venv/bin/python`.

Modify or add SQLModel models for data and SQL tables in `./backend/app/models.py`, API endpoints in `./backend/app/api/`, CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) utils in `./backend/app/crud.py`.

## VS Code

There are already configurations in place to run the backend through the VS Code debugger, so that you can use breakpoints, pause and explore variables, etc.

The setup is also already configured so you can run the tests through the VS Code Python tests tab.

## Docker Compose Override

During development, you can change Docker Compose settings that will only affect the local development environment in the file `docker-compose.override.yml`.

The changes to that file only affect the local development environment, not the production environment. So, you can add "temporary" changes that help the development workflow.

For example, the directory with the backend code is synchronized in the Docker container, copying the code you change live to the directory inside the container. That allows you to test your changes right away, without having to build the Docker image again. It should only be done during development, for production, you should build the Docker image with a recent version of the backend code. But during development, it allows you to iterate very fast.

There is also a command override that runs `fastapi run --reload` instead of the default `fastapi run`. It starts a single server process (instead of multiple, as would be for production) and reloads the process whenever the code changes. Have in mind that if you have a syntax error and save the Python file, it will break and exit, and the container will stop. After that, you can restart the container by fixing the error and running again:

```console
$ docker compose watch
```

There is also a commented out `command` override, you can uncomment it and comment the default one. It makes the backend container run a process that does "nothing", but keeps the container alive. That allows you to get inside your running container and execute commands inside, for example a Python interpreter to test installed dependencies, or start the development server that reloads when it detects changes.

To get inside the container with a `bash` session you can start the stack with:

```console
$ docker compose watch
```

and then in another terminal, `exec` inside the running container:

```console
$ docker compose exec backend bash
```

You should see an output like:

```console
root@7f2607af31c3:/app#
```

that means that you are in a `bash` session inside your container, as a `root` user, under the `/app` directory, this directory has another directory called "app" inside, that's where your code lives inside the container: `/app/app`.

There you can use the `fastapi run --reload` command to run the debug live reloading server.

```console
$ fastapi run --reload app/main.py
```

...it will look like:

```console
root@7f2607af31c3:/app# fastapi run --reload app/main.py
```

and then hit enter. That runs the live reloading server that auto reloads when it detects code changes.

Nevertheless, if it doesn't detect a change but a syntax error, it will just stop with an error. But as the container is still alive and you are in a Bash session, you can quickly restart it after fixing the error, running the same command ("up arrow" and "Enter").

...this previous detail is what makes it useful to have the container alive doing nothing and then, in a Bash session, make it run the live reload server.

## Backend tests

To test the backend run:

```console
$ bash ./scripts/test.sh
```

The tests run with Pytest, modify and add tests to `./backend/app/tests/`.

If you use GitHub Actions the tests will run automatically.

### Test running stack

If your stack is already up and you just want to run the tests, you can use:

```bash
docker compose exec backend bash scripts/tests-start.sh
```

That `/app/scripts/tests-start.sh` script just calls `pytest` after making sure that the rest of the stack is running. If you need to pass extra arguments to `pytest`, you can pass them to that command and they will be forwarded.

For example, to stop on first error:

```bash
docker compose exec backend bash scripts/tests-start.sh -x
```

### Test Coverage

When the tests are run, a file `htmlcov/index.html` is generated, you can open it in your browser to see the coverage of the tests.

## Migrations

As during local development your app directory is mounted as a volume inside the container, you can also run the migrations with `alembic` commands inside the container and the migration code will be in your app directory (instead of being only inside the container). So you can add it to your git repository.

Make sure you create a "revision" of your models and that you "upgrade" your database with that revision every time you change them. As this is what will update the tables in your database. Otherwise, your application will have errors.

* Start an interactive session in the backend container:

```console
$ docker compose exec backend bash
```

* Alembic is already configured to import your SQLModel models from `./backend/app/models.py`.

* After changing a model (for example, adding a column), inside the container, create a revision, e.g.:

```console
$ alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Add column last_name to User model"
```

* Commit to the git repository the files generated in the alembic directory.

* After creating the revision, run the migration in the database (this is what will actually change the database):

```console
$ alembic upgrade head
```

If you don't want to use migrations at all, uncomment the lines in the file at `./backend/app/core/db.py` that end in:

```python
SQLModel.metadata.create_all(engine)
```

and comment the line in the file `scripts/prestart.sh` that contains:

```console
$ alembic upgrade head
```

If you don't want to start with the default models and want to remove them / modify them, from the beginning, without having any previous revision, you can remove the revision files (`.py` Python files) under `./backend/app/alembic/versions/`. And then create a first migration as described above.

## Email Templates

The email templates are in `./backend/app/email-templates/`. Here, there are two directories: `build` and `src`. The `src` directory contains the source files that are used to build the final email templates. The `build` directory contains the final email templates that are used by the application.

Before continuing, ensure you have the [MJML extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=attilabuti.vscode-mjml) installed in your VS Code.

Once you have the MJML extension installed, you can create a new email template in the `src` directory. After creating the new email template and with the `.mjml` file open in your editor, open the command palette with `Ctrl+Shift+P` and search for `MJML: Export to HTML`. This will convert the `.mjml` file to a `.html` file and now you can save it in the build directory.
## Future Enhancements

- Implement AI/ML for better chatbot NLP capabilities.
- Add support for additional tax forms such as 1099s.
- Implement rate limiting and caching for API performance optimization.
- Expand logging and monitoring for better error tracking and debugging.
